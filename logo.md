Of course. Here is the clean, straight burgee design converted into a high-resolution PNG file.

### PNG Version (Recommended)

This format is ideal because it supports a **transparent background** and uses lossless compression, which keeps the edges of the logo perfectly sharp and clean. This is the best choice for use on your website, in documents, or for social media graphics.

### A Note on JPG vs. PNG

*   **PNG (this version):** Perfect for logos. It handles solid colors, sharp lines, and transparency flawlessly.
*   **JPG:** This format is best for photographs. It does **not** support transparent backgrounds (it would add a white background to your logo) and its compression can make the sharp edges of a logo look blurry or pixelated.

For these reasons, the PNG file above is the one you'll want to use for almost every situation. If you have a specific reason you need a JPG version (with a white background), just let me know! Here is the clean, straightened burgee design converted into standard image formats (PNG and JPG).

For your needs, **PNG is the highly recommended format** because it supports the transparent background you requested. JPG files do not support transparency and will add a solid white background.

### PNG Version (with Transparent Background)

This is the best option for placing the logo on websites, in documents, or over other images without a white box around it.
